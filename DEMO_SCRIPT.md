---

### **Demo 4: Perfect Query (2 minutes)**

#### **Query to Use**
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, status
FROM users 
WHERE status = 'active' 
  AND created_at >= '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50
```

#### **Demo Steps**
1. **Paste the optimized query**
2. **Analyze and show results**
3. **Highlight the "Great job!" message**
4. **Show the positive feedback system**

#### **Key Points**
- **Positive reinforcement**: Tool recognizes good queries
- **Best practices validation**: Confirms optimization efforts
- **Educational feedback**: Builds confidence in SQL skills

---

### **Demo 5: Technical Features (2 minutes)**

## üöÄ Advanced Features (3 minutes)

### **Rules Engine Deep Dive**

#### **Categories Overview**
- **Performance**: 4 rules (SELECT *, WHERE clauses, LIMIT usage)
- **Index**: 3 rules (SARGable conditions, LIKE patterns, suggestions)
- **JOIN**: 3 rules (Implicit joins, conditions, subquery conversion)
- **Structure**: 2 rules (DISTINCT usage, query organization)

#### **Severity System**
- **üî¥ High**: Critical performance impacts (missing WHERE, non-SARGable)
- **üü° Medium**: Important optimizations (SELECT *, implicit JOINs)
- **üü¢ Low**: Fine-tuning opportunities (DISTINCT, ORDER BY)

### **Complexity Scoring Algorithm**
- **Real-time calculation**: Based on query structure analysis
- **Weighted factors**: JOINs (+2), subqueries (+3), functions (+1)
- **Scale**: 0-100 with descriptive labels (Simple to Very Complex)

### **Extensibility**
- **Modular design**: Easy to add new optimization rules
- **Rule registration**: Simple Python method implementation
- **Category system**: Organized rule management
