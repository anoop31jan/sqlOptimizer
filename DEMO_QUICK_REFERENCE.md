## üé™ Demo Queries (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **Primary Demo Queries**
```sql
-- Performance Issues
SELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN'

-- JOIN Optimization  
SELECT * FROM users u, orders o, products p 
WHERE u.id = o.user_id AND o.product_id = p.id 
ORDER BY o.created_at

-- Perfect Query
SELECT id, name, email, status
FROM users 
WHERE status = 'active' 
  AND created_at >= '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50
```

### **Backup Queries**
```sql
-- Quick performance demo
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25;

-- Quick JOIN demo
SELECT * FROM users u, orders o WHERE u.id = o.user_id;

-- Missing WHERE demo
SELECT id, name, email FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## üîß Optimization Rules Quick Reference

### **Performance Rules**
- **SELECT \* Usage**: Medium severity - Unnecessary column retrieval
- **Missing WHERE**: High severity - Full table scan risk
- **Missing LIMIT**: Medium severity - Large result sets
- **Unnecessary DISTINCT**: Low severity - Performance overhead

### **Index Rules**
- **Non-SARGable Conditions**: High severity - Functions prevent index usage
- **Leading Wildcards**: Medium severity - LIKE '%pattern' can't use indexes
- **WHERE Column Indexes**: Medium severity - Missing index opportunities
- **ORDER BY Indexes**: Low severity - Sort optimization

### **JOIN Rules**
- **Implicit JOINs**: Medium severity - Comma syntax modernization
- **Missing JOIN Conditions**: High severity - Cartesian product risk
- **Subquery to JOIN**: Medium severity - Performance optimization

### **Structure Rules**
- **Function in WHERE**: Medium severity - Index usage prevention
- **ORDER BY without LIMIT**: Low severity - Expensive sorting
