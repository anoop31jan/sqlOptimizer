## 🤝 Demo Q&A Preparation

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: "How accurate are the optimization suggestions?"**
**A**: "The suggestions are based on established SQL best practices and are designed to be conservative. Each suggestion includes explanations and examples so developers can make informed decisions."

**Q: "Can this work with different databases?"**
**A**: "The current rules focus on standard SQL optimizations that apply across most databases. The architecture is designed to easily add database-specific rules."

**Q: "How does this compare to database query analyzers?"**
**A**: "This tool focuses on static analysis of query structure before execution, while database analyzers work with execution plans. They're complementary tools - this helps during development, analyzers help in production."

**Q: "Can we customize the rules?"**
**A**: "Absolutely! The rules engine is designed for extensibility. New rules can be added by implementing simple Python methods."

**Q: "What about SQL injection detection?"**
**A**: "While this tool focuses on performance optimization, the architecture could easily support security rule additions for injection detection."
